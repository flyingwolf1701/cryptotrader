ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Youâ€™re building a trading app with full Binance API integration and considering augmenting it using CoinGecko and potentially Twitter data for project sentiment and validation of trading signals.

ðŸ§  CoinGecko vs Binance
Binance: Great for real-time trading data via WebSockets, order book info, and executing trades.

CoinGecko: Better for project metadata, historical data, aggregated prices across exchanges, and community/developer stats.

No WebSocket support in CoinGecko; REST-only.

ðŸ”§ Proposed Architecture
CoinGecko REST Service

For price history, market cap, coin metadata, and social links.

Exchange WebSocket Client (e.g., Binance)

For real-time price and volume updates.

Backend Aggregator (e.g., FastAPI)

Combines data sources and feeds a unified API or UI.

(Optional) Frontend

Visualizes real-time and historical trends together.

ðŸ“Š Signal Validation Strategy
Youâ€™re interested in validating trading signals with social data. Suggested structure:

Composite Signal Score
Volume Spike (40%) â€” Current volume vs. historical average.

Price Action (30%) â€” % price change normalized.

Social Activity (20%) â€” Twitter buzz or follower growth.

Project Buzz (10%) â€” CoinGecko developer/community score.

Example formula:

```python
SignalScore = 0.4 * volume_score + 0.3 * price_score + 0.2 * social_score + 0.1 * project_buzz
```
